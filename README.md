# Virtual-Reality-Based-model-of-Solar-System
## Objective
Design a Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality 3D solar system simulation model to provide an immersive user experience using Unity 3D
## Approach
- **Earth Centric Scaling**: Implemented Earth-centric scaling to properly visualize planetary sizes, distances, & dynamics in the solar system simulation model
-  **Dynamics of Surface of Sun**: Utilized specific features of Unity 3D including **Universal Rendering Pipeline** & **Shader Graph** to create a dynamic & visually engaging sun
-  **Addition of User Engaging Features**: Enhanced user-VR interaction by adding various engaging features including zoom, play/pause, & focus
## Result
Successfully developed a fully interactive VR simulation with detailed planetary visualizations and user navigation controls, offering an immersive user experience
